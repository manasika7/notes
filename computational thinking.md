Computational Thinking 1
Agenda
- How computer works
- Binary System
- Algorithms
-------------
A computer is a device which accepts input and process this input 
automatically and gives output.
Cpu(Central processing unit):  Brain of the computer. responsible for all 
aritmetic and logical operations, coordination with other parts.
RAM (Random Access Memory)
Tempoarary Memory. When you turn off your computer all the data inside of 
it will disappear.
HDD(Hard Disk Drive): This is permanent memory. slowest memory. vulnerable 
to shocks.
SSD(Solid Drive Disk):
Permament, but much faster storage solution. No mechanical parts so hard 
to break.
Motherboard: All hardware, periphrels, cpu etc. should be connected to the 
motherboard.
It connects everything together.
Power supply: Feeds the system with electricity.

Binary System
On-Off system of computer
Difference with Decimal
ONly two digits 0, 1
Decimal 10 digits 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
HexaDecimal 16 Digits 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E
A1
Computer understands binary on-off, true or false.
Assignment:

ASCII
a system to represent text to computers.
We have 255 characters mapped on ASCII table.
There is another system called unicode. It's a newer system for different 
symbols, emojis, different alphabets. 4byte (32 bit)
how many character can you put inside 4 bytes?
Around 4 billion
Images
Images are being shown by RGB system in pixels. For every pizel on your 
monitor/TV/phone screen, applications are sending rgb values of every 
pixel to create that image.
GOT-Green screen tricks.
They're changing the green colored pixels with the one they created to 
form a 3d-dragon.
Videos
Regular movies are made 24fps. So every second your monitor is being 
refreshed 24 times. So your brain understands there is a motion. Actually 
there is no motion. Just changing the pixels from one color to another.
Homework
How does sound represented to a computer?
